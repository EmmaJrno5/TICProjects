      As one of the greatest tennis players of all time,<b>Novak Djokovic</b>
      has always being a source of moltivation to me and many aspiring
      professional tennis players.The fact that he came when the sport was
      dominated by the <b>Big Two(<i>Federer and Nadal</i>)</b> who were almost
      unbeatable on the the tennis tour and dominated the
      <b>Grandslams(<i>the most prestigious tournament in tennis</i>)</b>, all
      major tennis events and still made his own ground by beating them both in
      their prime and racking up <b>Grandslams</b> and other tropies along the
      way which paved the way for the name <b>The Big Three</b>. One thing I
      loved about him was his determination to be the best and not keep it to
      himself as when asked about him wanting to be the greatest,he answers with
      confidence and he's not passive about anything. When he says he wants to
      achieve something he does achieve it by working hard and following his
      goals with well planned strategies. That's why he broke a lot of
      impossible records and overtook Federer and Nadal in almost every
      possible records in Tennis including the highest of them all
      <b>the Grandslam</b> which he has won <b>24</b> of them to tie the most
      Grand slams won either by a Male or Female player with
      <b>Margaret Court</b>. He completed this feat last year at the
      <i>US open</i>, as last year for Novak was the best of the lot as he broke
      a lot of records to add to his incredible feat of 24 Grandslams.

      He is a relentless player with a crazy strong mentality and a game style
      that makes it a very difficult player to play against as he could drain
      you in a rally and also hit some very good groundstrokes with bite to
      finish the points. He is very flexible and tries to reach all balls as he
      covers all corners of the court with perfection, which is a habit I tried to
      emulate and got it to fit my gameplay. He is so energetic and athletic as
      he's not just good in Tennis but other sports too. <b>Novak</b> never
      gives up, even when he's losing or a point to losing a match. He always
      comes up top as he have proven a lot of times whether it's a five setter,
      three setter, final set, tie break or even a final with a lot of pressures
      he handles it very well like it doesn't affect him even if it does. He
      handles the crowd also well as even when he gets booed, he seems to
      motivate him to play better as he works on his mindset to believe he's not
      the being booed but cheered as he himself said.

      There have been arguments on who's the greatest of all time in tennis is
      for a long while now as fans are divided by their choices on the
      <b>Big Three</b>. For me it's definitely <b>Novak</b> as he has proven
      many times by breaking all possible records but due to a lot of fans not
      liking him and his attitude, they prefer more of
      <b><i>Federer or Nadal</i></b> as they are said to be gentlemen on and off
      courts and more humble. This is hypocrisy for me, because before Novak
      broke the records of most Grandslams, it was said that the person with the
      most Grandslams is the Greatest of all time and at that time it was
      <b><i>Federer</i></b> who was loved by all, but as soon as
      <b>Novak</b> became the Player with the most, the criteria for the fans
      changed and it's about being a gentleman,humble, loved by the fans and all
      other irrelevant sports related stuffs. I don't have anything against
      <b><i>Federer and Nadal</i></b> but <b>Novak</b> have proven himself time
      after time that he is worthy of that title. <b>Novak</b> might not be most
      likeable person or player because he's just being expressive about how he
      feels at most time which some fans take as arrogance and disrespect but I
      prefer when someone is straight forward about their actions rather than
      sugarcoating their words which is what most players do on the tennis tour
      do.

      <b>Novak</b> has inspired me to push to be a professional tennis player
      even though I have few shortcomings as there are a lot of distractions or
      the fact that our lifes and opportunities are different due to the fact
      that the place I live in is not really supportive. <b>Novak</b> also faced
      challenges too as he grew up during war and setbacks in his home country
      but never gave up on his dreams. <b>Novak</b> is my
      <b><i>role model</i></b> because he came up when everybody thought
      <b><i>Federer and Nadal</i></b
      >were unbeatable and he beat them even having a better head to head record
      against both of them overall even when he was the underdog. He rose to the
      highest level in Tennis and achieved great things, even though he makes it
      difficult for we upcoming new generation players to break his records
    .
